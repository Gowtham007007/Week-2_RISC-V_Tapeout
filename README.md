# Week-2_RISC-V_Tapeout
Hands-on exploration of SoC architecture and simulation using the VSDBabySoC project — a RISC-V–based System on Chip. Covers core concepts like RVMYTH CPU, PLL, and DAC integration, along with Verilog-based pre- and post-synthesis simulations using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave.
